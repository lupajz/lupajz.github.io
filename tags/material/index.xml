      <description>Last week as Google announced release of Android P preview they also release first alpha version of new support library that includes, amongst many interesting changes, new additions to design support library. From now on the library will include new MaterialButton, MaterialCardView, layout for Chips and BottomAppBar, also I hope weâ€™ll get BackLayerLayout in future releases.
BottomAppBar, being an extensions of Toolbar, feels like a compromise to provide user with some actions comfortably without the need to reach for them with thumb in the Toolbar on top on devices with bigger screen.</description>
